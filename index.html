                    <h2>Blessed Sacrament School</h2>
                    <p>For my early education, I attended a private Catholic school in my hometown of Madison, WIsconsin. I was there for a total of 9 years, from kindergarten through 8th grade. I wasn't a fan of the religious aspect of the education, but I made some great friends in those years, some of whom I still see regularly!</p>

                    <h2>Edgewood High School</h2>
                    <p>For high school, I attended yet another private Catholic school. Again, I found the religious influence on the school's rules and regulations to be pretty annoying, but the actual education I received was really valuable. It was definitely a good prep school.</p>

                    <h2>UW Milwaukee</h2>
                    <p>I only spent a few semesters at UWM, but I found my time there to be worthwhile in many ways. I learned how to push myself as student and worker, and I also built important social skills that I definitely did not have in high school.</p>

                    <h2>Hatch Building Supply</h2>
                    <p>Hatch Building Supply is a small business that sells tools and materials for working with concrete and other construction-related materials.Working at Hatch was the first real job I ever had. I started when I was 19 years old, working in the warehouse. I developed so many important work and interpersonal skills there. I seriously owe that place so much.</p>

                    <h2>Raven Software</h2>
                    <p>Working at Raven was completely different from my experience at Hatch. I went from working in warehouse on my feet all day, to sitting at a desk using a computer for 8 hours. I also learned a valuable lesson from them when they let me go. They Had a fairly lax start time policy, but apparently I was still too tardy one too many times. Being fired from a job I liked definitely helped me rethink how I approach work and helped me become a better employee.</p>

                    <h2>Raven Software</h2>
                    <p>Working at Hunter Engineering Company&reg has been the first and only job I've had since moving to Saint Louis last year. The people are nice, and the setting is familiar (I work in the warehouse, but I'm at a computer most of the day) I like it there, but I'm really hoping to use Launch Code to break into a tech career and move on from Hunter.</p>

                    <p>That's about it for my education and work background. Hopefully you leanred a bit more about me from this. Thank you for reading!</p>
